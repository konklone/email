6. In the 'Host Name' field you will almost always want to enter only a single '@' character. This field determines which domain the MX record refers to. An '@' character routes mail through the domain you selected in step 4. The only reason to enter anything else is if you'd like to route through a subdomain (e.g. ftp.mydomain.com or support.mydomain.com). If you really want to do this, enter the subdomain name under 'Host Name' (in the previous examples, 'ftp' or 'support').

7. In the 'Enter Go To Address' field, enter the name of an MX record you want to add. Leave all other fields at their default settings.
